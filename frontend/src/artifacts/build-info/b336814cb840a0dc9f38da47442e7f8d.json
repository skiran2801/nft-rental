Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}. Emits a {Transfer} event.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/interfaces/IERC721.sol\":\"IERC721Extended\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x5bce51e11f7d194b79ea59fe00c9e8de9fa2c5530124960f29a24d4c740a3266\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7e66dfde185df46104c11bc89d08fa0760737aa59a2b8546a656473d810a8ea4\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmXvyqtXPaPss2PD7eqPoSao5Szm2n6UMoiG8TZZDjmChR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Enumerable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd1556954440b31c97a142c6ba07d5cade45f96fafd52091d33a14ebe365aecbf\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://26fef835622b46a5ba08b3ef6b46a22e94b5f285d0f0fb66b703bd30217d2c34\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZ548qdwfL1qF7aXz3xh1GCdTiST81kGGuKRqVUfYmPZR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x75b829ff2f26c14355d1cba20e16fe7b29ca58eb5fef665ede48bc0f9c6c74b9\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://a0a107160525724f9e1bbbab031defc2f298296dd9e331f16a6f7130cec32146\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmemujxSd7gX8A9M8UwmNbz4Ms3U9FG9QfudUgxwvTmPWf\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x447a5f3ddc18419d41ff92b3773fb86471b1db25773e07f877f548918a185bf1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://be161e54f24e5c6fae81a12db1a8ae87bc5ae1b0ddc805d82a1440a68455088f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP7C3CHdY9urF4dEMb9wmsp1wMxHF6nhA2yQE5SKiPAdy\"]},\"contracts/interfaces/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x64e0aa4d6227c5978449fc90c24cade5373fc0508e272ab474a2af015f45564a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6c7cc4828f92451a3746826fc5c7a16b34c332ef9cc59d110fec95e4a6ea977f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbZvk27C2G1c8VUteJeNPxusMkQNT1BezY8nQMQem8nHB\"]}},\"version\":1}"}}}}}
